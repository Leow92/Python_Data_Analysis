# Python_Data_Analysis
Analysis of data about the readmission or not of diabetic patients

Our goal was to clean, structure and analyze the data. We did Machine Learning on the dataset to determine if a patient would be readmitted or not.

Our project contains :
- the dataset : "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008"
- a FLASK API: we predict your readmission to the hospital with your data 
- a Jupyter Notebook
- an explaining powerpoint
